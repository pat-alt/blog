## A comfortable bubble ðŸŽˆ

For many years I have used R Markdown for essentially anything work-related. As a young econ student facing the unfortunate reality that people still teach Stata, I was drawn to R, because of its great open-source community and also because it's not Stata. Once I realised that I would be able to use R Markdown to write up all of my future homework assignments and even my thesis, I never even looked back. Not much later I would also begin developing apps in Shiny, produce outputs in HTML and build entire websites through `blogdown` - and all of that from within R Studio. During my first professional job at the Bank of England I was reluctant to use anything other than R Markdown to produce all of my output. Luckily for me, the Bank was very much heading in that same direction at the time and my reluctance was not perceived as stubbornness but innovativeness. 

#### Cracks in the bubble

Soon, however, I would also feel somewhat boxed in. For any work that required me to look outside of the R bubble, I knew I might also have to give up R Markdown. During my master's in Data Science, for example, the mantra was "Python or die". Through `reticulate` and R Studio's Python support I managed to get by without having to leave my beloved R Markdown behind. But `reticulate` always felt a little clunky (sorry!) and some professors were reluctant to accept anything other than Jupyter notebooks. Even if others had not perceived it that way in the past, I certainly started to feel that I might just be a little too attached the beautiful bubble that R Studio had created for me. 

#### Julia scratches the bubble

Then there was Julia: elegant, fast, scientific and - oh my REPL - those beautiful colors and unicode symbols. The stuff of dreams, really! I had once before given Julia a try when working with high-frequency trade data for a course in market microstructure. This was the first time R really revealed its limitations to me and my bubble nearly burst, but through `data.table` and `Rcpp` I managed to escape tears at the time. Still, Julia kept popping up, teasing me whenever I work on some Frakenstein C++ code snippets that would hopefully resolve my R bottlenecks. 

#### It bursts

As I started my PhD a few months ago, I eventually gave in. New beginnings - time to suck it up! If it would mean that I have to use Jupyter notebooks, so be it! And so I was off to a somewhat bumpy start that would have me bouncing back and forth between trying to make Julia work in R Studio (meh), setting up Jupyter Lab (meeeh), just using the Julia REPL because "the REPL is all you need" (nope) and struggling with Vim and Emacs. Then there is also Pluto.jl, of course, which admittedly looks amazing. But it also looks very much tailored to Julia and (I believe) the number of different output formats you can produce is still very limited. Eventually, I settled for VSCode in combination with Jupyter notebooks. As much as I dreaded the latter, Jupyter is popular, arguably versatile and supports both R and Julia. This setup worked well enough for me, but it still definitely fell short of the breeze that R Markdown had always provided. One thing that really bugged me was the fact that the IJulia kernel was not accessible from the Julia REPL, for example. Each notebook would have its own environment, which could only be accessed through the notebook. In R Studio the interaction between R Markdown and the console is seamless, as both have access to the same environment variables. 

#### Enter: Quarto

Around the same time that I started using Julia in September 2021, I read about Quarto for the first time. It looked ... great! But also ... unfinished? Definitely experimental at the time. I loved the idea though and in a footnote somewhere on their website it said that the project was supported by R Studio (good sign!). So I decided to at least give it a quick try and built a small (tiny) [website](https://www.paltmeyer.com/tai/) summarising some of the literature I had read for my PhD:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just had my first go <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/quarto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#quarto</a> and I absolutely love the concept! Open-source and language agnostic - truly amazing work from <a href="https://twitter.com/rstudio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rstudio</a> <a href="https://t.co/veCg7ywQ8v">https://t.co/veCg7ywQ8v</a></p>&mdash; Patrick Altmeyer (@paltmey) <a href="https://twitter.com/paltmey/status/1454042807019180035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This was a first very pleasant experience, even smoother than `blogdown`. As for working with Julia though, I had made up my mind that VSCode was the way to go and at the time there was no Quarto extension (there is [now](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto)). There was also little in terms of communication about the project by R Studio, probably because things were really still in the early development stages. 

#### Quarto and Jupyter

I kept coming back to quarto though. Since I was now working with VSCode + Jupyter and since Quarto supported Jupyter as well as all of my old R Markdown work, my next little Quarto project involved turning my old `blogdown`-powered blog into a Quarto-powered [blog](https://www.paltmeyer.com/blog/). This was not strictly necessary, as I could always export my new Jupyter notebooks to HTML and let `blogdown` do the rest. But it did streamline things a little bit and the default Quarto blog looks fresh. I also did not have to feel guilty towards [@xieyihui](https://twitter.com/xieyihui) about leaving `blogdown`, because unsurprisingly he is on the Quarto team. As I was working on this little project I started noticing that the Quarto website was updated regularly and responses to issues I opened like this [one](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/293) were answered very swiftly. Clearly, things were moving and they were moving fast. More recently, the news about Quarto have been spreading and let some folks as confused and amazed as I was when I first heard about it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RStats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RStats</a> can someone explain to me what&#39;s the difference between {Quarto} and {RMarkdown}? I saw a tweet about Quarto and now I&#39;m all confused ... What gap is it supposed to fill?</p>&mdash; Erwin Lares (@lasrubieras) <a href="https://twitter.com/lasrubieras/status/1509014670262390784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is why finally I've decided I should write a brief post about how and why I use Quarto. Since I have been working mostly with Julia for the past couple of months, I've chosen to focus on the interaction between Quarto and Julia. Coincidentally, today was also the first time I saw a [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html) dedicated to Julia on the Quarto website, so evidently I am not the only one interested in that marriage. 

## Quarto and Julia - a perfect match

While what follows may be relevant to other programming languages, my main goal here is to showcase the beauty of Quarto to the Julia community. In any case, #rstats folks have been using R and Python in R Markdown documents for a while now and won't need much of an introduction to Quarto. As for Python aficionados, I can only recommend to give Quarto a shot (you will still be able to use Jupyter notebooks). 

#### Working with VSCode, Quarto and Julia

The very article you are reading right now was composed in a Quarto document. They feel and look very much like standard Julia Markdown documents, but you can do a lot more with them. To get started, here is my current setup:

1. VSCode extensions: in addition to the [Julia extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia) you will need the [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto). In addition, the [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) and some extension to preview Markdown docs would be helpful. I am not sure if [Markdown Julia](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=colinfang.markdown-julia) and [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) are strictly necessary, but it won't hurt.
2. Make sure that the `.qmd` document has access to a `Pkg.jl` environment that has `IJulia` added. 

Julia code cells look like this 

```` markdown

```{{julia}}
#| label: fig-intro
#| fig-cap: "A little animation"

using Plots
```

````

```{julia}
using Javis, Animations, Colors

function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

rotate_anim = Animation(
    [0, 1], # must go from 0 to 1
    [0, 2Ï€],
    [sineio()],
)

translate_anim = Animation(
    [0, 1], # must go from 0 to 1
    [O, Point(150, 0)],
    [sineio()],
)

translate_back_anim = Animation(
    [0, 1], # must go from 0 to 1
    [O, Point(-150, 0)],
    [sineio()],
)

color_anim = Animation(
    [0, 0.5, 1], # must go from 0 to 1
    [Lab(colorant"red"), Lab(colorant"cyan"), Lab(colorant"black")],
    [sineio(), sineio()],
)

video = Video(600, 400)
Background(1:200, ground)

for frame_start in 1:10:50
    blob = Object(frame_start:frame_start+149, (args...) -> circle(O, 20, :fill))
    act!(blob, Action(1:10, sineio(), appear(:scale))) # new line
    act!(blob, Action(1:30, translate_anim, translate()))
    act!(blob, Action(31:120, rotate_anim, rotate_around(Point(-150, 0))))
    act!(blob, Action(121:150, translate_back_anim, translate()))
    act!(blob, Action(1:150, color_anim, sethue()))
end

render(
    video;
    pathname = joinpath(www_path, "intro.gif"),
)
```

#### Working with `Documenter.jl` and Quarto

The interaction of `Documenter.jl` and Quarto is perhaps best demonstrated through this Julia library I recently developed: [`CounterfactualExplanatinos.jl`](https://github.com/pat-alt/CounterfactualExplanations.jl). On there you will find lot of Julia scripts `*.jl` under `src/` and `test/`, as well as many Markdown `.md` and Quarto documents `.qmd` under `docs`. I wrote the package documentation in the Quarto documents, rendered them individually through `quarto render [doc].qmd` and then fed the resulting Markdown documents to `Documenter.jl` as always.
