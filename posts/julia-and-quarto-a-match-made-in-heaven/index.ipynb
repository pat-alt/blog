        "Does your work involve research, coding, writing and publishing? If so, then chances are that you often find yourself bouncing back and forth between different open-source text editors, IDEs, programming languages and platforms depending on your current needs. Using a diverse set of tools is reasonable, because there typically is no single perfect approach to solves all problems. For example, interactive notebooks like Jupyter are useful for with code and communicating it to others, but they are probably not your first choice for producing a scientific article. Similarly, Beamer presentations can be useful for presenting science in a standardized fashion, but they are the very opposite of interactive and look incredibly boring. \n",
        "\n",
        "As much as this great variety of free tools deserves being celebrated, all this bouncing back and forth can be really tiring. What if there was a single tool, an engine that can turn your work into all kinds of different outputs? I mean literally any output you can think of: Markdown, HTML, PDF, LateX, ePub, entire websites, presentations (yes, also Beamer if you have to), MS Word, OpenOffice, ... the list goes on. All of that starting from the same place: a plain Markdown document blended with essentially any programming language of your choice and a YAML header defining your output. This tool now exists and it goes by the name [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).\n",

        "In this short blog post I hope to convince you that Quarto is the only publishing engine you will ever need. What I am definitely not going to tell you is which IDE, text editor or programming language you should be using to actually produce your work. Quarto does not care about that. Quarto is here to make your life a bit easier (and by 'a bit' I mean a whole lot). Quarto is nothing less but revolutionary for science. \n",

        "For many years I have used R Markdown for essentially anything work-related. As a young econ student facing the unfortunate reality that people still teach Stata, I was drawn to R, because of its great open-source community and also because it's not Stata. Once I realised that I would be able to use R Markdown to write up all of my future homework assignments and even my thesis, I never even looked back. Not much later I would also begin developing apps in Shiny, produce outputs in HTML and build entire websites through `blogdown` - and all of that from within R Studio. During my first professional job at the Bank of England I was reluctant to use anything other than R Markdown to produce all of my output. Luckily for me, the Bank was very much heading in that same direction at the time and my reluctance was not perceived as stubbornness but innovativeness. \n",

        "Soon, however, I would also feel somewhat boxed in. For any work that required me to look outside of the R bubble, I knew I might also have to give up R Markdown. During my master's in Data Science, for example, the mantra was \"Python or die\". Through `reticulate` and R Studio's Python support I managed to get by without having to leave my beloved R Markdown behind. But `reticulate` always felt a little clunky (sorry!) and some professors were reluctant to accept anything other than Jupyter notebooks. Even if others had not perceived it that way in the past, I certainly started to feel that I might just be a little too attached the beautiful bubble that R Studio had created for me. \n",

        "Then there was Julia: elegant, fast, scientific and - oh my REPL - those beautiful colors and unicode symbols. The stuff of dreams, really! I had once before given Julia a try when working with high-frequency trade data for a course in market microstructure. This was the first time R really revealed its limitations to me and my bubble nearly burst, but through `data.table` and `Rcpp` I managed to escape tears at the time. Still, Julia kept popping up, teasing me whenever I work on some Frakenstein C++ code snippets that would hopefully resolve my R bottlenecks. \n",

        "As I started my PhD a few months ago, I eventually gave in. New beginnings - time to suck it up! If it would mean that I have to use Jupyter notebooks, so be it! And so I was off to a somewhat bumpy start that would have me bouncing back and forth between trying to make Julia work in R Studio (meh), setting up Jupyter Lab (meeeh), just using the Julia REPL because \"the REPL is all you need\" (nope) and struggling with Vim and Emacs. Then there is also Pluto.jl, of course, which admittedly looks amazing. But it also looks very much tailored to Julia and (I believe) the number of different output formats you can produce is still very limited. Eventually, I settled for VSCode in combination with Jupyter notebooks. As much as I dreaded the latter, Jupyter is popular, arguably versatile and supports both R and Julia. This setup worked well enough for me, but it still definitely fell short of the breeze that R Markdown had always provided. One thing that really bugged me was the fact that the IJulia kernel was not accessible from the Julia REPL, for example. Each notebook would have its own environment, which could only be accessed through the notebook. In R Studio the interaction between R Markdown and the console is seamless, as both have access to the same environment variables. \n",

        "Around the same time that I started using Julia in September 2021, I read about Quarto for the first time. It looked ... great! But also ... unfinished? Definitely experimental at the time. I loved the idea though and in a footnote somewhere on their website it said that the project was supported by R Studio (good sign!).

As for working with Julia though, I had made up my mind that VSCode was the way to go and at the time there was no Quarto extension (there is [now](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto)).

Since I was now working with VSCode + Jupyter and since Quarto supported Jupyter as well as all of my old R Markdown work, my next little Quarto project involved turning my old `blogdown`-powered blog into a Quarto-powered [blog](https://www.paltmeyer.com/blog/). This was not strictly necessary, as I could always export my new Jupyter notebooks to HTML and let `blogdown` do the rest. But it did streamline things a little bit and the default Quarto blog looks fresh. I also did not have to feel guilty towards [\\@xieyihui](https://twitter.com/xieyihui) about leaving `blogdown`, because unsurprisingly he is on the Quarto team. As I was working on this little project I started noticing that the Quarto website was updated regularly and responses to issues I opened like this [one](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/293) were answered very swiftly. Clearly, things were moving and they were moving fast. More recently, the news about Quarto have been spreading and let some folks as confused and amazed as I was when I first heard about it:\n",
